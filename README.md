Live REPL available here: http://cell-lang.org

Cell is a toy language based on the original Lisp specification. I wrote this interpreter solely for the purpose of learning how Lisp works, so please do not attempt to use it for any real project. As always, any comments or criticisms are welcome.

This implementation was influenced heavily by:
  * [Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions, and Their Computation by Machine - John McCarthy, 1960](http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.html)
  * [Lithp, a Lisp implementation in Python - Michael Fogus](http://fogus.me/fun/lithp/)
  * [Clojure, a modern Lisp dialect for the JVM - Rich Hickey](http://clojure.org/)
